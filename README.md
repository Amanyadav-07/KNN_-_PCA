# KNN & PCA: Theoretical and Practical Implementation

This repository contains both theoretical explanations and practical implementations of **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**. The theoretical part covers fundamental concepts, while the practical part includes Python implementations using **scikit-learn**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
- **KNN_&_PCA_Theoretical_Questions.ipynb** - Contains theoretical explanations of KNN and PCA.
- **KNN_&_PCA_Practical_Implementation.ipynb** - Hands-on Python implementation of KNN and PCA models.
- **README.md** - Project documentation.

## üöÄ Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed:
```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Notebooks
Use Jupyter Notebook to run the `.ipynb` files:
```sh
jupyter notebook
```
Then, open the respective notebook to explore the theoretical and practical aspects of KNN and PCA.

## üî¨ Implemented Concepts
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- KNN Classification & Regression
- Distance Metrics Comparison
- Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Feature Scaling & Imputation
- Decision Boundary Visualization

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Variance Explained by Components
- PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA with KNN Classifier
- Data Reconstruction & Scree Plot

## üìä Results & Analysis
- Comparative analysis of different distance metrics in KNN
- Effect of `K` value on classification and regression performance
- Impact of PCA on model accuracy and variance reduction
